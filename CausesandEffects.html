            There are various ways Climate Change affects our seas, one of those ways are caused by greenhouse gases.
            Did you know that greenhouse gases trap energy from the sun, and as they trap that energy, the oceans are
            absorbing way more heat than there suppost to. This results to an increase in sea temperatures and rising
            of sea levels. If we continue to let this happen the changes in the oceans temperature and currents will
            lead to alterations in climate patterns around the world.

          <h2 class="mb1">Carbon Dioxide</h2>
          <p class="info-section-para">
            Another way is corbon dioxide. Too much carbon dioxide affects sea water.There are both natural and human
            sources of carbon dioxide. Natural sources include decompostation, ocean release and respiration. Human
            sources come from activities like deforestation, burning of fossil fuels like coal and cement production.
            When it is too much sea water dissolves carbon dioxide to make corbonic acid which affects marine life. So
            how exactly does this happen? Let me explain. Our seas are like an incredible carbon sink- they absorb
            about 25 percent of carbon dioxide produced by humans each year. The result, not so suprising, is that the
            ocean becomes more acidic. This is really upsetting beacause millions and millions of organisms rely on
            these oceans, and even us as humans depend on the ocean for food and survival.
